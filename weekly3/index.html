  <h2>What is the relationship of speed or velocity and digital images?</h2>
  <p> Poor images are poor because they are heavily compressed and travel quickly.  They lose matter and gain speed. Poor images are poor because they are not assigned any value within the class society of images but, on the other hand, the rampant privatization of intellectual content, along with online marketing and commodification, also enables piracy and appropriation; it gives rise to the circulation of poor images.</p>
