  <h2>Do you agree with foucault that your own life is shaped through these systems of control? Explain.</h2>
  <p>I do agree that our lives are shaped through these systems of control because I believe that the way most citizens act is by abiding their perception of what is right. This perception of right and wrong is a construct that enables certain people to be in control within society. I also find that the individuals who act outside of the accordance of this standard do so because they have a different perception of what is right that contradicts the standard. I also think that the individuals who act out completely and do things that are considered malignant do so because they feel no empathy, remorse, or guilt which makes them have no attachment to the standard.  </p>
