    <h1>What is the relationship between diagrams, maps and networks?</h1>
<p>Diagrams, maps and networks hold a relationship in that they all show connections between areas and supply channels of interactivity through these connections. Non-art diagrams are visual representations that are meant to demonstrate information accurately and clearly in an easy to follow format. Art diagrams are created to test the limits of logic and thought and “reveal their tenuous philosophical underpinnings.” (Whittle, 2017) </p>
