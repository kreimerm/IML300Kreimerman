  <h2>Can thought go on without a body?</h2>
  <p>I donâ€™t think so. Since thought seems to be based on the experience of the gender it must have a body in order to formulate thoughts.</p>

  <h2>What do you think the role of suffering is within the space of this argument?</h2>
  <p>That people should challenge what has already been established as truth. Machines need to suffer from the burden of their memory in order for them to start thinking. </p>
