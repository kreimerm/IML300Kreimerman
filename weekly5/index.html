  <h2>Do you think humans can be undestood through cybernetics?</h2>
  <p>I think cybernetics can provide an approach for understanding humans but I dont think that it can fully explain the complexity of society and our interaction with one another and our world. </p>

  <h2>Is cybernetcs a usefull tool for describing reality?</h2>
  <p>I think that the way it was presented in the film was not an accurate prediction of how society would interact. The theme of ending power systems is not accurate today, but to a certain extent I can see how cybernetics can be a way of interpreting reality depending on how the topic is approached.</p>
