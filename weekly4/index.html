  <h2>How is Rauschenberg's work different form other collage work that came before it?</h2>
  <p> Previous works were always a case of translating a three-dimensional thing onto a two dimensional field and doing so in terms of a set of traces which themselves had no dimension. The obvious features of this translation were apparent changes in scale from object to image and in texture from the natural surface to the medium of depiction. The image removed the object from the space of the world, installing it in a space of an entirely different order. The new space was in the nature of a projection and because it was irrevocably separated off from reality, it understood to transcend reality. The cubist use of collage elements intensified the situation by making the process of image formation more apparent. </p>
